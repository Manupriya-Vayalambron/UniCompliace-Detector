# UniCompliace-Detector
DIPLOMA FINAL YEAR MAJOR PROJECT: Unicompliance Detector is a software that checks whether a student is in proper uniform or not following the institution's dress code using object detection and gives a voice output of the student's status. The program also records details of late comers to institution by using face recognition. 
This system also stores the attendance details in firebase database. The training images of face recognition are also uploaded in firebase. We have used PyCharm as our IDE.
For object detection, we have used yolov8m algorithm aand for face recognition we have used the corresponding python libraries.
